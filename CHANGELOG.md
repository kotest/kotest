Changelog
=========

This project follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

Version 2.0.0, released 2017-03-26
----------------------------------

[Closed Issues](https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest/milestone/4?closed=1)

### Added

* You can write tests alternatively into a lambda parameter in the class constructor, eg:

```kotlin
class StringSpecExample : StringSpec({
  "strings.size should return size of string" {
    "hello".length shouldBe 5
    "hello" should haveLength(5)
  }
})
```

* Added `forNone` for table tests, eg

```kotlin
val table = table(
    headers("a", "b"),
    row(0L, 2L),
    row(2L, 2L),
    row(4L, 5L),
    row(4L, 6L)
)

forNone(table) { a, b ->
  3 shouldBe between(a, b)
}
```

* Interceptors have been added. Interceptors allow code to be executed before and after a test. See the main readme for more info.

* Simplified ability to add custom matchers. Simple implement `Matcher<T>` interface. See readme for more information.

* Added `shouldNot` to invert matchers. Eg, `"hello" shouldNot include("hallo")`

* Deprecated matchers which do not implement Matcher<T>. Eg, `should have substring(x)` has been deprecated in favour of `"hello" should include("l")`. This is because instances of Matcher<T> can be combined with `or` and `and` and can be negated with `shouldNot`.

* Added `between` matcher for int and long, eg

```3 shouldBe between(2, 5)```

* Added `singleElement` matcher for collections, eg

```x shouldBe singleElement(y)```

* Added `sorted` matcher for collections, eg

```listOf(1,2,3) shouldBe sorted<Int>()```

* Now supports comparsion of arrays #116

* Added Gen.oneOf<Enum> to create a generator that returns one of the values for the given Enum class.

### Changed

* Tags are objects derived from `Tag` class now.
* Tags can now be included and/or exluded. It is no longer the case that all untagged tests are
always executed.
* Fixed bugs with parenthesis breaking layout in Intellij #112

### Removed

* FlatSpec was removed because it has an irregular syntax with `config` and is essentially the same
as StringSpec, but more complicated.
* Deprecated method overloads with `duration: Long, unit: TimeUnit`
* `expecting` for testing exceptions (use shouldThrow now)


Version 1.3.2, released 2016-07-05
----------------------------------

### Changed

* Added `a shouldBe exactly(b)` matcher for doubles

* `kotlintest` only pulls in `mockito-core` now instead of `mockito-all`


Version 1.3.1, released 2016-07-03
----------------------------------

### Changed

* Bumped Kotlin version to 1.0.3

Version 1.3.0, released 2016-07-03
----------------------------------

[Closed Issues](https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2.0)

### Added

* StringSpec. You can use simply use Strings as the basis for tests, eg:

```kotlin
class StringSpecExample : StringSpec() {
  init {
    "strings.size should return size of string" {
      "hello".length shouldBe 5
      "hello" should haveLength(5)
    }

    "strings should support config" {
      "hello".length shouldBe 5
    }.config(invocations = 5)
  }
}
```

* Table Tests. Tables allow you to manually specific combinations of values that should be used, and are useful for 
edge cases and other specific values you want to test. The headers are used for when values fail, 
the output can show you what inputs were used for what labels. An example of using a table consisting of two-value tuples:

```kotlin
class TableExample : StringSpec(), TableTesting {
  init {
    "numbers should be prime" {
      val table = table(
          headers("a", "b"),
          row(5, 5),
          row(4, 6),
          row(3, 7)
      )
      forAll(table) { a, b ->
        a + b == 10
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* Property tests. Property tests automatically generate values for testings. You provide, or have KotlinTest provide for you, `generators`, which will generate a set of values and the unit test will be executed for each of those values. An example using two strings and asserting that the lengths are correct:

```kotlin
class PropertyExample: StringSpec() {

  "String size" {
    forAll({ a: String, b: String ->
      (a + b).length == a.length + b.length
    })
  }

}
```

That test will be executed 100 times with random values in each test. See more in the readme.

* autoClose. Fields of type `Closeable` can be registered for automatic resource closing:

```kotlin
class StringSpecExample : StringSpec() {
  val reader = autoClose(StringReader("xyz"))
  
  ...
}
```

* `haveLength` matcher. You can now write for strings:

```kotlin
someString should haveLength(10)
```


* `haveSize` matcher. You can now write for collections:

```kotlin
myCollection should haveSize(4)
```

* `contain` matcher. You can now write

```kotlin
val col = listOf(1,2,3,4,5)
col should contain(4)
```

* `containInAnyOrder` matcher. You can now write

```kotlin
val col = listOf(1,2,3,4,5)
col should containInAnyOrder(4,2,3)
```

* `haveKey` Map<K,V> matcher. You can now write

```kotlin
val map = mapOf(Pair(1, "a"), Pair(2, "b"))
map should haveKey(1)
```

* `haveValue` Map<K,V> matcher. You can now write

```kotlin
val map = mapOf(Pair(1, "a"), Pair(2, "b"))
map should haveValue("a")
```

* `contain` Map<K,V> matcher. You can now write

```kotlin
val map = mapOf(Pair(1, "a"), Pair(2, "b"))
map should contain(1, "a")
```

* `beTheSameInstanceAs` reference matcher. This is an alias for `x should be theSameInstanceAs(y)`, allowing `x should beTheSameInstanceAs(y)` which fits in with new matcher style.

### Changed

#### Replaced `timeout` + `timeUnit` with `Duration` ([#29](https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest/issues/29))

You can now write `config(timeout = 2.seconds)` instead of 
`config(timeout = 2, timeoutUnit = TimeUnit.SECONDS)`.

### Deprecated

nothing

### Removed

nothing

### Fixed

* Ignored tests now display properly. https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest/issues/43
* Failing tests reported as a success AND a failure https://github.com/kotlintest/kotlintest/issues/42
