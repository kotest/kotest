The Kotest test framework is supported on JVM, Javascript and Native.
To enable Kotest for multiple platforms, combine the steps for the individual platforms as detailed in the following tabs.

:::caution
The KMP support in Kotest 6.0 has changed from the previous versions. There is no longer a compiler plugi but a simplified setup.
Please see the rest of this page for details on how to configure Kotest for KMP in Kotest 6.0 and later.

A working project with JVM support can be found here:
https://github.com/kotest/kotest-examples
:::

Kotest on the JVM has two ways for running tests. One uses the [Kotest gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.kotest), which provides detailed test output in the console, and a rich experience in Intellij (in conjuction with the Intellij Kotest plugin).
The other option uses the [JUnit Platform](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-build-gradle) gradle plugin which is ubiquitous in the JVM ecosystem but lacks some features of the Kotest gradle plugin.

To use the Kotest gradle plugin, add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
   id("io.kotest") version "$version"
}
```

Add the following dependency to your build:

```kotlin
dependencies {
   testImplementation("io.kotest:kotest-framework-engine:$version")
}
```

And then execute the `kotest` task in gradle, or run tests directly from the IDE.

To use the JUnit Platform plugin, add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
tasks.withType<Test>().configureEach {
   useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

Add the following dependency to your build:

```kotlin
dependencies {
   testImplementation("io.kotest:kotest-runner-junit5:$version")
}
```

And then execute the `test` task in gradle, or run tests directly from the IDE.

   <TabItem value="JS">

:::tip
A working JS project can be found here: https://github.com/kotest/kotest-examples
:::

Add the [Kotest gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.kotest) and Google KSP plugin to to your build.

For example:

```kotlin
plugins {
   id("io.kotest") version "$version"
   id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "2.2.0-2.0.2"
}
```

Add the engine dependency to your `commonTest` or `jsTest` source set:

```kotlin
kotlin {
   js()
   sourceSets {
      jsTest {
         dependencies {
            implementation("io.kotest:kotest-framework-engine:$version")
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Tests can be placed in either `commonTest` or `jsTest`.
Run your tests using the `jsKotest` gradle task.

:::note
The JS test engine is feature limited when compared to the JVM test engine. The major restriction is that annotation
based configuration will not work as Kotlin does not expose annotations at runtime to JS code.

   <TabItem value="WasmJS">

:::tip
A working WasmJS project can be found here: https://github.com/kotest/kotest-examples
:::

Add the [Kotest gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.kotest) and Google KSP plugin to to your build.

For example:

```kotlin
plugins {
   id("io.kotest") version "$version"
   id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "2.2.0-2.0.2"
}
```

Add the engine dependency to your `commonTest` or `wasmJsTest` source set:

```kotlin
kotlin {
   wasmJs()
   sourceSets {
      wasmJsTest {
         dependencies {
            implementation("io.kotest:kotest-framework-engine:$version")
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Tests can be placed in either `commonTest` or `wasmJsTest`.
Run your tests using the `wasmJsKotest` gradle task.

:::note
The WasmJS test engine is feature limited when compared to the JVM test engine. The major restriction is that annotation
based configuration will not work as Kotlin does not expose annotations at runtime to Wasm code.

   <TabItem value="Native">

:::tip
A working native project with linux, windows and macos configured, with unit and data driven test examples, can be found here:
https://github.com/kotest/kotest-examples
:::

Add the [Kotest gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.kotest) and Google KSP plugin to to your build.

For example:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("io.kotest") version "$version
  id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "2.2.0-2.0.2"
}
```

Add the engine dependency to your `commonTest`, `nativeTest` or platform specific sourceset:

```kotlin
kotlin {
   linuxX64() // add any supported native target
   sourceSets {
      nativeTest {
         dependencies {
            implementation("io.kotest:kotest-framework-engine:$version")
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Tests can be placed in either `commonTest` or a specific native sourceset.
Run your tests using the kotest tasks that mirror the target names, for example `linuxX86Kotest`.

:::note
The native test engine is feature limited when compared to the JVM test engine. The major restriction is that annotation
based configuration will not work as Kotlin does not expose annotations at runtime to native code.

   <TabItem value="Android">

:::info
Currently, only Unit tests are supported in Kotest.
The following steps enable Kotest to be used for unit tests, where the Android framework is not needed or is mocked that usually reside in the
`src/test` folder of your module.
:::

Kotest on Android uses the [JUnit Platform](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-build-gradle) gradle plugin.
This requires configuring the android test options block in your build file and then adding the Kotest junit5 runner dependency.

```kotlin
android.testOptions {
   unitTests.all {
      it.useJUnitPlatform()
   }
}
```

```kotlin
dependencies {
   testImplementation 'io.kotest:kotest-runner-junit5:version'
}
```
