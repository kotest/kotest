JUnit XML Format Reporter
=======


JUnit includes an XML report generator that it calls the [legacy xml report](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.5.0-RC2/api/org/junit/platform/reporting/legacy/xml/LegacyXmlReportGeneratingListener.html). Many tools integrate with this format so it is very useful.
However, this report has no concept of nesting tests. Therefore when used with a nested [test style](styles.md) in Kotest, it will include parent tests as orphans.

To solve this, Kotest has it's own implementation of the same format, that is configurable on whether to include parent tests and/or collapse the names.



To set this up, we need to add the `JunitXmlReporter` to our project through [project config](project_config.md).

```kotlin
class MyConfig : AbstractProjectConfig() {
   override fun listeners(): List<Listener> = listOf(
      JunitXmlReporter(
         includeContainers = false,
         useTestPathAsName = true
      )
   )
}
```


Additionally, the reporter needs to know where your build output folder is by setting a system property, so we configure that in the tests block in gradle.

```kotlin
tasks.named<Test>("test") {
   useJUnitPlatform()
   systemProperty("gradle.build.dir", project.buildDir)
}
```


### Parameters

The reporter has two parameters:

* `includeContainers` when true, all intermediate tests are included in the report as tests in their own right. Defaults to false.
* `useTestPathAsName` when true, the full test path will be used as the name. In other words the name will include the name of any parent tests as a single string.
