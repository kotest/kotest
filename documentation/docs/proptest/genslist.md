This page lists all current generators in Kotest. There are two types of generator: [arbitrary](gens.md#arbitrary)
and [exhaustive](gens.md#exhaustive).

Most generators are available on all platforms. Some are JVM or JS specific.

We also provide generators for [Arrow](arrow.md) as a separate module.
