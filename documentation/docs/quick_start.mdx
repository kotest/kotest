Kotest is divided into several, stand alone, subprojects, each of which can be used independently:

* [Test framework](framework/index.md)
* [Assertions library](assertions/index.md)
* [Property testing](proptest/index.mdx)

You can decide to go _all in_ on Kotest, and use all three together, or you can choose to one or more modules in conjunction with other projects.
For example, you could use the assertions library with JUnit, or you could use the test framework with another assertions library like assertj.

This page gives setup instructions for various combinations of projects and targets.

:::note
Kotest is a [multi-platform project](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html).
If you are unfamiliar with this, then Kotlin compiles to different targets - JVM, JS, Native, iOS and so on. If you are doing server side or android development then you want the modules that end with JVM, such as `kotest-property-jvm`.
:::

## Test Framework

The Kotest test framework is supported on JVM, Javascript and Native.
To enable Kotest for multiple platforms, combine the steps for the individual platforms as detailed in the following tabs.

<Tabs
   defaultValue="JVM/Gradle"
   values={[
      {label: 'JVM/Gradle', value: 'JVM/Gradle'},
      {label: 'JVM/Maven', value: 'JVM/Maven'},
      {label: 'Kotlin/JS', value: 'JS'},
      {label: 'Kotlin/Native', value: 'Native'},
      {label: 'Android', value: 'Android'},
   ]}>
   <TabItem value="JVM/Gradle">

Kotest on the JVM uses the [JUnit Platform](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-build-gradle) gradle plugin.
For Gradle 4.6 and higher this is as simple as adding `useJUnitPlatform()` inside the tasks with type `Test`
      and then adding the Kotest junit5 runner dependency.

If you are using Gradle + Groovy then:

```groovy
test {
   useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

Or if you are using Gradle + Kotlin then:

```kotlin
tasks.withType<Test>().configureEach {
   useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

And then the dependency:

```groovy
testImplementation 'io.kotest:kotest-runner-junit5:$version'
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="JS">

:::tip
A working multi-platform project with JVM, native and Javascript all configured, with unit and data driven test examples, can be found here:
https://github.com/kotest/kotest-examples-multiplatform
:::

Add the [Kotest multiplatform gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.kotest.multiplatform) to your build.

For example:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("io.kotest.multiplatform") version "5.0.2"
}
```

Add the engine dependency to your `commonTest` dependencies block:

```kotlin
kotlin {
  targets {
    js(IR) { // LEGACY or BOTH are unsupported
      browser() // to compile for the web
      nodejs() // to compile against node
    }
  }

  sourceSets {
    val commonTest by getting {
      dependencies {
        implementation("io.kotest:kotest-framework-engine:$version")
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::caution
Only the new IR compiler backend for Kotlin/JS is supported. If you are compiling JS with the legacy compiler backend then you will not be
able to use Kotest for testing.
:::

Write your tests using [FunSpec](framework/styles.md#fun-spec), [ShouldSpec](framework/styles.md#should-spec) or [StringSpec](framework/styles.md#string-spec).
      Tests can be placed in either `commonTest` or `jsTest`
source sets. Run your tests using the `gradle check` command.

The Javascript test engine is feature limited when compared to the JVM test engine. The major restriction is that annotation
      based configuration will not work as Kotlin does not expose annotations at runtime to javascript code.

:::note
Tests for Javascript cannot nest tests. This is due to the underlying Javascript test runners (such as Mocha or Karma)
      not supporting promises in parent tests, which is incompatible with coroutines and in Kotest every test scope is a coroutine.
      This is why the supported specs are limited to `FunSpec`, `ShouldSpec` and `StringSpec`.
:::

:::info
The IntelliJ Kotest plugin does not support running common, native or JS tests directly from the IDE using the green run icons.
Only execution via gradle is supported.

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="Native">

Add the [Kotest multiplatform gradle plugin](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.kotest.multiplatform) to your build.

For example:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("io.kotest.multiplatform") version "5.0.2"
}
```

Add the engine dependency to your `commonTest` dependencies block:

```kotlin

    linuxX64() // can add any supported native targets such as linux, mac, windows etc
  }
}
sourceSets {
  val commonTest by getting {
    dependencies {
      implementation("io.kotest:kotest-framework-engine:$version")
    }
  }
}
```

Tests can be placed in either `commonTest` or a specific native sourceset.
      Run your tests using the `gradle check` command.

The native test engine is feature limited when compared to the JVM test engine. The major restriction is that annotation
based configuration will not work as Kotlin does not expose annotations at runtime to native code.

:::note
The IntelliJ Kotest plugin does not support running common, native or JS tests from the IDE. You will need to use
the `gradle check` task.

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="JVM/Maven">

For maven you must configure the surefire plugin for junit tests.

```xml
<plugin>
   <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
   <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>2.22.2</version>
</plugin>
```

And then add the Kotest JUnit5 runner to your dependencies section.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.kotest</groupId>
   <artifactId>kotest-runner-junit5-jvm</artifactId>
   <version>{version}</version>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="Android">

:::info
Currently, only JVM tests are officially supported in Kotest. We are open to suggestions on how to support UI tests.

The following steps enable Kotest to be used for unit and integration tests, where the Android framework is not needed or is mocked that usually reside in the
`src/test` folder of your module.
:::

Kotest on Android uses the [JUnit Platform](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-build-gradle) gradle plugin.
This requires configuring the android test options block in your build file and then adding the Kotest junit5 runner dependency.

```kotlin
android.testOptions {
   unitTests.all {
      it.useJUnitPlatform()
   }
}
```

```groovy
dependencies {
   testImplementation 'io.kotest:kotest-runner-junit5:version'
}
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="Multiplatform">

To configure the test framework for both JS and JVM, you just combine copy the steps for JVM and JS.

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>




## Assertions Library





The core assertions library framework is supported on all targets. Submodules are supported on the platforms that applicable.
For example, the JDBC matchers only work for JVM since JDBC is a Java library.



<Tabs
   defaultValue="JVM/Gradle"
   values={[
      {label: 'JVM/Gradle', value: 'JVM/Gradle'},
      {label: 'JVM/Maven', value: 'JVM/Maven'},
      {label: 'Multiplatform', value: 'Multiplatform'},
   ]}>
   <TabItem value="JVM/Gradle">

Add the following dependency to your build:

```groovy
testImplementation 'io.kotest:kotest-assertions-core:$version'
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="JVM/Maven">

Add the following dependency to your build.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.kotest</groupId>
   <artifactId>kotest-assertions-core-jvm</artifactId>
   <version>{version}</version>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="Multiplatform">

Add the following dependency to your commonTest dependencies block:

```groovy
implementation 'io.kotest:kotest-assertions-core:$version'
```

Alternatively, add the dependency to a specific target. For example, we could add to the Javascript target only.

```kotlin
kotlin {
   targets {
      js {
         browser()
         nodejs()
      }
   }
   sourceSets {
      val jsTest by getting {
         dependencies {
            implementation("io.kotest:kotest-assertions-core:$version")
         }
      }
   }
}
```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>














## Property Testing


The property test framework is supported on all targets.


<Tabs
   defaultValue="JVM/Gradle"
   values={[
      {label: 'JVM/Gradle', value: 'JVM/Gradle'},
      {label: 'JVM/Maven', value: 'JVM/Maven'},
      {label: 'Multiplatform', value: 'Multiplatform'},
   ]}>
   <TabItem value="JVM/Gradle">

Add the following dependency to your build:

```groovy
testImplementation 'io.kotest:kotest-property:$version'
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="JVM/Maven">


Add the following dependency to your build.

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>io.kotest</groupId>
   <artifactId>kotest-property-jvm</artifactId>
   <version>${version}</version>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="Multiplatform">

Add the following dependency to your commonTest dependencies block:

```groovy
implementation 'io.kotest:kotest-property:$version'
```


Alternatively, add the dependency to a specific target. For example, we could add to the Javascript target only.

```kotlin
kotlin {
   targets {
      js {
         browser()
         nodejs()
      }
   }
   sourceSets {
      val jsTest by getting {
         dependencies {
            implementation("io.kotest:kotest-property:$version")
         }
      }
   }
}
```



   </TabItem>
</Tabs>




## Snapshots

Snapshot are automatically published on each commit to master.
If you want to test the latest snapshot build, setup the same way described above, change the version to the current snapshot version and add the following repository to your `repositories` block:

```
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots
```
