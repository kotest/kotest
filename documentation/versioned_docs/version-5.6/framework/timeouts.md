Kotest supports timeouts at several execution points.
These timeouts allow you to place a constraint on the overall execution time of a test, an invocation or an entire project.

The following pages detail how to enable timeouts:
  * [test and invocation timeouts](timeouts/test_timeouts.md)
  * [project timeouts](timeouts/project_timeout.md)
