Testing Styles
==============

Kotest offers 10 different styles of test layout. Some are inspired from other popular test frameworks to make you feel right at home.
Others were created just for Kotest.

| Test Style | Inspired By |
| --- | --- |
| [Fun Spec](#fun-spec) | ScalaTest |
| [Describe Spec](#describe-spec) | Javascript frameworks and RSpec |
| [Should Spec](#should-spec) | A Kotest original |
| [String Spec](#string-spec) | A Kotest original |
| [Behavior Spec](#behavior-spec) | BDD frameworks |
| [Free Spec](#free-spec) | ScalaTest |
| [Word Spec](#word-spec) | ScalaTest |
| [Feature Spec](#feature-spec) | Cucumber |
| [Expect Spec](#expect-spec) | A Kotest original |
| [Annotation Spec](#annotation-spec) | JUnit |

There are no functional differences between the styles.
All allow the same types of configuration &mdash; threads, tags, etc &mdash;
 it is simply a matter of preference how you structure your tests.

Some teams prefer to mandate usage of a single style, others mix and match. Do whatever feels right for your team.

### Fun Spec

`FunSpec` allows you to create tests by invoking a function called `test` with a string parameter to describe the test,
and then the test itself as a lambda. If in doubt, this is the style to use.

```kotlin
class MyTests : FunSpec({
	test("String length should return the length of the string") {
		"sammy".length shouldBe 5
		"".length shouldBe 0
	}
})
```

Tests can be disabled using the `xcontext` and `xtest` variants (in addition to the [usual ways](conditional_evaluation.md))

```kotlin
class MyTests : DescribeSpec({
    context("this outer block is enabled") {
        xtest("this test is disabled") {
            // test here
        }
    }
    xcontext("this block is disabled") {
      test("disabled by inheritance from the parent") {
        // test here
      }
    }
})
```


### String Spec

`StringSpec` reduces the syntax to the absolute minimum.
 Just write a string followed by a lambda expression with your test code.

```kotlin
class MyTests : StringSpec({
	"strings.length should return size of string" {
		"hello".length shouldBe 5
	}
})
```

Adding config to the test.

```kotlin
class MyTests : StringSpec({
	"strings.length should return size of string".config(enabled = false, invocations = 3) {
		"hello".length shouldBe 5
	}
})
```

Note that this is the only Spec that does not support nesting.

### Should Spec

`ShouldSpec` is similar to fun spec, but uses the keyword `should` instead of `test`.

```kotlin
class MyTests : ShouldSpec({
	should("return the length of the string") {
		"sammy".length shouldBe 5
		"".length shouldBe 0
	}
})
```


Tests can be nested in one or more context blocks as well:

```kotlin
class MyTests : ShouldSpec({
	context("String.length") {
		should("return the length of the string") {
			"sammy".length shouldBe 5
			"".length shouldBe 0
		}
	}
})
```

Tests can be disabled using the `xcontext` and `xshould` variants (in addition to the [usual ways](conditional_evaluation.md))

```kotlin
class MyTests : ShouldSpec({
    context("this outer block is enabled") {
        xshould("this test is disabled") {
            // test here
        }
    }
    xcontext("this block is disabled") {
      should("disabled by inheritance from the parent") {
        // test here
      }
    }
})
```

### Describe Spec

`DescribeSpec` offers a style familiar to those from a Ruby or Javascript background, as this testing style
 uses `describe` / `it` keywords. Tests must be nested in one or more `describe` blocks.

```kotlin
class MyTests : DescribeSpec({
    describe("score") {
        it("start as zero") {
            // test here
        }
        describe("with a strike") {
            it("adds ten") {
                // test here
            }
            it("carries strike to the next frame") {
                // test here
            }
        }

        describe("for the opposite team") {
          it("Should negate one score") {
            // test here
          }
        }
    }
})
```

Tests can be disabled using the `xdescribe` and `xit` variants (in addition to the [usual ways](conditional_evaluation.md))

```kotlin
class MyTests : DescribeSpec({
    describe("this outer block is enabled") {
        xit("this test is disabled") {
            // test here
        }
    }
    xdescribe("this block is disabled") {
      it("disabled by inheritance from the parent") {
        // test here
      }
    }
})
```

### Behavior Spec

Popular with people who like to write tests in the _BDD_ style, `BehaviorSpec` allows you to use `given`, `when`, `then`.

```kotlin
class MyTests : BehaviorSpec({
    given("a broomstick") {
        `when`("I sit on it") {
            then("I should be able to fly") {
                // test code
            }
        }
        `when`("I throw it away") {
            then("it should come back") {
                // test code
            }
        }
    }
})
```

Because `when` is a keyword in Kotlin, we must enclose it with backticks. Alternatively, there are title case versions
available if you don't like the use of backticks, eg, `Given`, `When`, `Then`.

You can also use the `And` keyword in `Given` and `When` to add an extra depth to it:

```kotlin
class MyTests : BehaviorSpec({
    given("a broomstick") {
        and("a witch") {
            `when`("The witch sits on it") {
                and("she laughs hysterically") {
                    then("She should be able to fly") {
                        // test code
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
})
```

Note: `Then` scope doesn't have an `and` scope due to a Gradle bug. For more information, see [#594](https://github.com/kotest/kotest/issues/594).

Tests can be disabled using the `xgiven`, `xwhen`, and `xthen` variants (in addition to the [usual ways](conditional_evaluation.md))

```kotlin
class MyTests : DescribeSpec({
    xgiven("this is disabled") {
        When("disabled by inheritance from the parent") {
            then("disabled by inheritance from its grandparent") {
                // disabled test
            }
        }
    }
    given("this is active") {
        When("this is active too") {
            xthen("this is disabled") {
               // disabled test
            }
        }
    }
})
```

### Word Spec

`WordSpec` uses the keyword `should` and uses that to nest tests after a context string.

```kotlin
class MyTests : WordSpec({
	"String.length" should {
		"return the length of the string" {
			"sammy".length shouldBe 5
			"".length shouldBe 0
		}
	}
})
```

It also supports the keyword `When` allowing to add another level of nesting. Note, since `when` is a keyword
in Kotlin, we must use backticks or the uppercase variant.

```kotlin
class MyTests : WordSpec({
	"Hello" When {
		"asked for length" should {
			"return 5" {
				"Hello".length shouldBe 5
			}
		}
		"appended to Bob" should {
			"return Hello Bob" {
				"Hello " + "Bob" shouldBe "Hello Bob"
			}
		}
	}
})
```

### Free Spec

`FreeSpec` allows you to nest arbitrary levels of depth using the keyword `-` (minus), as such:

```kotlin
class MyTests : FreeSpec({
    "String.length" - {
        "should return the length of the string" {
            "sammy".length shouldBe 5
            "".length shouldBe 0
        }
    }
    "containers can be nested as deep as you want" - {
        "and so we nest another container" - {
            "yet another container" - {
                "finally a real test" {
                    1 + 1 shouldBe 2
                }
            }
        }
    }
})
```

### Feature Spec

`FeatureSpec` allows you to use `feature` and `scenario`, which will be familiar to those who have used [cucumber](http://docs.cucumber.io/gherkin/reference/).
Although not intended to be exactly the same as cucumber, the keywords mimic the style.

```kotlin
class MyTests : FeatureSpec({
	feature("the can of coke") {
		scenario("should be fizzy when I shake it") {
			// test here
		}
		scenario("and should be tasty") {
			// test here
		}
	}
})
```

Tests can be disabled using the `xfeature` and `xscenario` variants (in addition to the [usual ways](conditional_evaluation.md))

```kotlin
class MyTests : FeatureSpec({
    feature("this outer block is enabled") {
        xscenario("this test is disabled") {
            // test here
        }
    }
    xfeature("this block is disabled") {
      scenario("disabled by inheritance from the parent") {
        // test here
      }
    }
})
```

### Expect Spec

`ExpectSpec` is similar to `FunSpec` and `ShouldSpec` but uses the `expect` keyword.

```kotlin
class MyTests : ExpectSpec({
    expect("my test") {
        // test here
    }
})
```

Tests can be nested in one or more context blocks as well:

```kotlin
class MyTests : ExpectSpec({
    context("a calculator") {
        expect("simple addition") {
            // test here
        }
        expect("integer overflow") {
            // test here
        }
    }
})
```

Tests can be disabled using the `xcontext` and `xexpect` variants (in addition to the [usual ways](conditional_evaluation.md))

```kotlin
class MyTests : DescribeSpec({
    context("this outer block is enabled") {
        xexpect("this test is disabled") {
            // test here
        }
    }
    xcontext("this block is disabled") {
      expect("disabled by inheritance from the parent") {
        // test here
      }
    }
})
```

### Annotation Spec

If you are migrating from JUnit then `AnnotationSpec` is a spec that uses annotations like JUnit 4/5.
Just add the `@Test` annotation to any function defined in the spec class.

You can also add annotations to execute something before tests/specs and after tests/specs, similarly to JUnit.

Although this spec doesn't offer any advantage over using JUnit itself, it allows you to migrate faster, as you typically just need to adjust imports.

```
@BeforeAll / @BeforeClass
@BeforeEach / @Before
@AfterAll / @AfterClass
@AfterEach / @After
```

If you want to ignore a test, use `@Ignore`.

```kotlin
class AnnotationSpecExample : AnnotationSpec() {

    @BeforeEach
    fun beforeTest() {
        println("Before each test")
    }

    @Test
    fun test1() {
        1 shouldBe 1
    }

    @Test
    fun test2() {
        3 shouldBe 3
    }
}
```
