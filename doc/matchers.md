Matchers
==========

This page lists all current matchers in Kotlintest. Matchers can be used in two styles:

 * Extension functions like `a.shouldBe(b)` or `a.shouldStartWith("foo")`
 * Infix functions like `a shouldBe b` or `a should startWith("foo")`

Both styles are supported. The advantage of the extension function style is that the IDE can autocomplete for you,
 but some people may prefer the infix style as it is slightly cleaner.

Matchers can be negated by using `shouldNot` instead of `should` for the infix style. For example, `a shouldNot startWith("boo")`.
For the extension function style, each function has an equivalent negated version, for example, `a.shouldNotStartWith("boo")`.

| General | |
| -------- | ---- |
| `obj.shouldBe(other)` | General purpose assertion that the given obj and other are both equal |
| `expr.shouldBeTrue()` | Convenience assertion that the expression is true. Equivalent to `expr.shouldBe(true)` |
| `expr.shouldBeFalse()` | Convenience assertion that the expression is false. Equivalent to `expr.shouldBe(false)` |
| `shouldThrow<E> { block }` | General purpose construct that asserts that the block throws an exception of E or a subtype of E |
| `shouldThrowExactly<E> { block }` | General purpose construct that asserts that the block throws an exception of exactly E |
| `shouldThrowAny<E> { block }` | General purpose construct that asserts that the block throws an exception of any type (including Throwable) |

| Types ||
| ------- | ---- |
| `obj.shouldBeSameInstanceAs(other)` | Compares objects by identity, that is, they are the same exact reference. |
| `obj.shouldBeTypeOf<T>()` | Asserts that the given reference is exactly of type T. Subclass will fail. Ie, `1 should beOfType<Number>` would fail because although 1 _is_ a Number, the runtime type is not Number. |
| `obj.shouldBeInstanceOf<T>` | Asserts that the given reference is of type T or a subclass of T. |
| `obj.shouldHaveAnnotation(annotationClass)` | Asserts that the object has an annotation of the given type. |
| `obj.shouldBeNull()` | Asserts that a given reference is null.|
