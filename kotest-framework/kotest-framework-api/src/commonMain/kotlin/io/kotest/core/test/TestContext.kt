/**
 * A test in Kotest is simply a function `suspend TestContext.() -> Unit`
 *
 * The [TestContext] receiver allows the test function to interact with the test engine at runtime.
 * For instance fetching details of the executing test case (such as timeouts, tags),
 * registering a dynamic nested test, or adding a test lifecycle callback.
 *
 * This context extends [CoroutineScope] giving the ability for any test function to launch
 * coroutines directly, without requiring them to supply a coroutine scope, and to retrieve
 * elements from the current [CoroutineContext] via [CoroutineContext.get]
