This is the legacy compiler plugin for the old Kotlin/Native compiler backend.

This plugin will be removed once it is no longer supported by the Kotlin compiler.
(This is tracked in [KT-51301](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-51301/Remove-ability-to-use-Native-non-embeddable-compiler-jar-in-Gradle-plugin).)

Changes made here should also be made in [`kotest-framework-multiplatform-plugin-embeddable-compiler`](../kotest-framework-multiplatform-plugin-embeddable-compiler).
