/**
 * A [Spec] is the top most container of tests.
 *
 * It allows tests to be defined, either through DSL-methods or via annotated methods, or
 * through any user defined way by subclassing this class and implementing [rootTests].
 *
 * Test case defaults can be specified by either assignment to the settings var's or
 * by overriding the applicable setting function and returning the required value.
 *
 * For example, to set a default timeout for all tests in a spec, one can do either:
 *
 * ```
 * timeout = 100.seconds
 * ```
 *
 * or
 *
 * ```
 * override fun timeout() = 100.seconds
 * ```
 *
 * The former is useful for declaring inside an init block and the latter useful for outside.
 * They are functionally equivalent.
 *
 * Lifecycle callbacks, such as before and after test can be registered, either by defining
 * an inline lambda or by overriding the appropriate function.
 *
 * For example, to apply a before-test callback, one can do either:
 *
 * ```
 * beforeTest { println("bonjour!") }
 * ```
 *
 * or
 *
 * ```
 * override fun beforeTest() { println("bonjour!") }
 * ```
 *
 * Functions to register [AutoCloseable] instances can be found in [AutoClosing].
 *
