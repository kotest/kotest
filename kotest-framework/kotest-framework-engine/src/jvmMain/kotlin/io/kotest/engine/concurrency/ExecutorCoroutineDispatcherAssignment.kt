/**
 * Each spec has one or more root tests and each of these tests will execute in its own coroutine.
 *
 * By default, a single threaded dispatcher is used and shared for all tests and all specs.
 * This is suitable for tests that suspend but not for tests that block.
 *
 * The [threads] parameter in global configuration allows overriding how many threads
 * are used when executing tests.
 *
 * By default, all tests in the same spec have dispatcher [affinity] - that is all tests in the same
 * spec will always use the same thread, to ensure that all callbacks for all tests (e.g. beforeTest)
 * operate on the same thread. This helps avoid subtle memory model issues on the JVM for those who are not
 * familiar with how the JVM guarantees updates to variables are visible across threads.
 *
 * This does mean however that inside a given spec, a blocked test will also block other tests in
 * that spec. Swings and roundabouts. To allow each test to have its own thread, set dispatcher
 * affinity to false, either globally, or on a per spec basis.
